## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2020-03-20
### Added
* A JSONSchema DSL (see `statham/dsl/`) has been added, and is
  now used for both the internal representation and the output.
* `anyOf` composition keyword now supported.
    - Creates models for each schema provided in the list.
    - Generated models will instantiate the first compatible model,
      based on the order they are presented.
* `oneOf` composition keyword now supported.
    - Creates models for each schema provided in the list.
    - Generated models will instantiate any compatible model, but
      fail if more than one succeeds.

### Changed
* Naming of anonymous schemas declared within the items
  of an array now uses the context of the array name.
    - For example, items of a list declared under field `volumes`,
      would previously have been named `Items`, but would now be
      named `VolumesItem`.
* Generated models switched to using a new DSL model.
* Schemas defined in the top-level `definitions` keyword are now
  detected.
* Now uses `json-ref-dict` version 0.5.0. Enables compatibility
  with a wider range of schemas.
* Name counters only increment for objects on autogenerated names.

### Removed
* Dependencies on `attrs` and `jinja2`.

### Fixed
* Name collisions where the last segment of the JSON Pointer for
  a schema's location was the same as another.
* Array schemas now accept missing items keyword as an implicit
  blank schema.
* Error reporting improved on cyclical dependencies.
* Fixed bug in title formatting.

## [0.1.1] - 2019-12-13
### Fixed
* Fix documentation now that package is available via `pip`.

## [0.1.0] - 2019-12-13
### Added
* Command run as `statham --input {reference} [--output {output}]`

  parse JSONSchema documents.

    - `number`
    - `integer`
    - `string`
    - `null`
* Declaration resolution for declared models.

    - `array`:
        + `items`
        + `minItems`
        + `maxItems`
    - `object`:
        + `properties`

        + `exclusiveMaximum`
        + `multipleOf`
    - `string`:
        + `default`
        + `format` (via extensible validation register)
